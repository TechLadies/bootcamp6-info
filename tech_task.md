# Bootcamp 6 Technical Task

## Introduction

The TechLadies Bootcamp is a 13-week part-time accelerated learning program designed for women who wish to be professional programmers. Participants will be guided by industry experts to create products for different NGOs.

Visit the [bootcamp info](http://www.techladies.co/bootcamp-6) page for more details.

## The Technical Task

To apply to the bootcamp, you need to complete a technical task that will help us evaluate your technical capabilities.

We are here to help you acquire the skills you need to complete the task with 3 pre-bootcamp workshops covering: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and VueJS.

We have 2 assignments that you can choose from. **Choose one to work on.**

### 1) Frontend focused tech assignment

* Make a visual web app that shows us how much you know about building a website.
* We recommend using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) to build the web app.
* This web application should have the following features:
    * An **About Me** page with a few paragraphs describing who you are, why you want to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp, and include one image (it can be a photo of yourself or anything you like (cats are always a good option!))
    * A **Contact Me** page with info on how to reach you online (eg. LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter).
    * A navigation bar which allows you to navigate between the **About Me** and **Contact Me** Display page.
* **Stretch goal:**
    * ***You don't need to do this, and we won't mark you down if you ignore this section.***
    * Use the Weather Forecast public APIs here ([https://data.gov.sg/dataset/weather-forecast](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/weather-forecast)) to add a weather forecast page to your website.
    * The **Weather Forecast** page should use the public API ([https://data.gov.sg/dataset/weather-forecast](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/weather-forecast)), create a page to display the retrieved data. It could be a simple table element.

### 2) Backend focused tech assignment

* Build a JSON REST API service using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with [Postgres DB](https://www.postgresql.org/).
* The API should be able to help us save and retrieve the following details to/from a local DB for different users:
    * An **About Me** paragraph describing who you are, why you want to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp.
    * **Contact Me** linksÂ info on how to reach you online (eg. LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter).
* Create tables in the DB which will save these details based on a user identifier.
* **Stretch goal:**
    * ***You don't need to do this, and we won't mark you down if you ignore this section.***
    * Protect your API with authentication. Simple username and password authentication is sufficient.

To stand out from the rest, you are highly encouraged to not follow a single online tutorial to the T. Do read up on multiple resources to understand the concepts or google your way to finding how to accomplish what you want to code.

## Submitting Your Entry

1. After you have finished building your personal website, you will need to share the source code with us. You should do so:
    * Through a link to a Git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com) (its free!)
    * Through a link to a Zip file on [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
    * Create a new repo and [push your commits in](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
2. Email the repo link or the uploaded Zip link to <b>[bootcamp@techladies.co](mailto:bootcamp@techladies.co)</b>
